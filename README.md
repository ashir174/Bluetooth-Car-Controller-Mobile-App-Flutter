# 🚗 ESP32-BLE Car Controller

This project is a Flutter + Firebase mobile application integrated with ESP32 hardware to control and monitor a smart Bluetooth-enabled car. It combines mobile app development, IoT hardware programming, and cloud integration to deliver a complete solution for remote car operation.

# 🔑 Key Features

🎮 Car Navigation

Joystick-based control for forward, backward, left, and right movement.

Smooth and low-latency command transmission via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

# 💡 Utility Controls

Toggle switches for front and back lights.

Dedicated Horn button for activation.

Adjustable Speed control slider.

# 🌡 Real-Time Monitoring

Live temperature readings from ESP32 sensors.

Interactive gauge visualization inside the Flutter app.

# ☁️ Firebase Integration

User authentication for secure access.

Cloud database support for logging and monitoring usage data.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: Flutter (Dart), Material UI, Custom Widgets

Backend / Cloud: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore/Realtime Database)

Hardware: ESP32 microcontroller with BLE support

Communication Protocol: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

# ⚙️ Hardware Setup

ESP32 board programmed with Arduino IDE (C++)

# Connected peripherals:

Motors for navigation

LEDs for front/back lights

Buzzer for horn

Temperature sensor (e.g., DHT11/22 or DS18B20)

BLE services/characteristics used for sending/receiving commands

# 📱 App Features (Flutter)

Intuitive joystick interface for movement

Switches and buttons for utilities (lights, horn)

Dynamic speed control

Real-time temperature gauge

Firebase-powered authentication and data storage

# 🚀 Future Improvements

Add voice command support for car control

Extend Firebase integration for data analytics

Enable Wi-Fi control for longer range

Add AI-based obstacle detection

✨ This project demonstrates the integration of Flutter mobile apps, Firebase cloud services, and ESP32 hardware programming to create a functional IoT-based smart car controller.
